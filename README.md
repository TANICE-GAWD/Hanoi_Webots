# Hanoi_Webots

##  Description

The Hanoi_Webots repository demonstrates robotic automation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. A simulated YouBot robot equipped with a Kinect depth sensor autonomously identifies disk positions, plans movements using a recursive algorithm, and executes precise manipulation sequences to solve the puzzle. The implementation prioritizes vision-based precision over pre-programmed positions, making the system resilient to placement variations.
